        Examine the following C++ subroutine:
        <pre class="brush:cpp">
          void count(int from, int to) {
              for (int i = from; i &lt; to; ++i) {
                  std::cout &lt;&lt; "Thread " &lt;&lt; std::this_thread::get_id() &lt;&lt; ": "
                            &lt;&lt; "my number is " &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; ".\n";
              }
          }
        </pre>
        Create a program which creates three separate threads using this
        subroutine:  1 to count from 1000 to 2000, one from 2000 to 3000, and
        one from 3000 to 4000.  You should see the output jumbled up a bit
        (much more so on Unix systems than on Windows).
        <p>
          Now add a <code>mutex</code> and a <code>lock_guard</code> to use
          for <code>cout</code> so that each line of the output is guaranteed
          to be uninterrupted.  The lines themselves should still be jumbled
          up (much more so on Unix systems than on Windows).
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Challenge:</em> create an RAII approach for output that will
          automatically lock and unlock a single output statement.  For
          example, your approach might look like the following code.  It
          should lock and unlock each output statement.
        </p>
        <pre class="mid brush:cpp">
          locked(cout) &lt;&lt; "Hello from thread " &lt;&lt; this_thread::get_id() &lt;&lt; "!\n";
          locked(cout) &lt;&lt; "My count is currently " &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; ".\n";
        </pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        Write a program which compares user input to a large list of English
        words to decide if the input is spelled correctly.  Your program
        should take a list of words to use as a command line argument.  This
        file should just have one word per line.  I suggest you use the
        file <a href="wordlist.txt">wordlist.txt</a> as your word list.
        <p>
          After you have read in the wordlist, begin accepting input
          from <code>cin</code>.  You program should accept three different
          commands.  Each command should be executed on its own thread in
          order to remain responsive (so that the main thread is always
          reading input from <code>cin</code>).  The commands are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The string <code>"end"</code> should exit the program immediately;
            you do not have to wait for other threads to finish.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the string begins with "add ", then take the remainder of the
            string as a word.  Add it to the word list if it is not there
            already.
          </li>
          <li>
            Otherwise, you should take the entire string and try to find it in
            the word list
            <ul>
              <li>Compare the string against every word in the word list
                using a linear search.</li>
              <li>
                If you find a match, print <code>"word" is correct</code>,
                where <var>word</var> is the word entered
              </li>
              <li>
                If you do not find a match, print "<var>word</var> is
                incorrect", where <var>word</var> is the word entered.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Use a shared mutex to protect all accesses to the word list.
          Spellcheck threads should be allowed to run in parallel.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
